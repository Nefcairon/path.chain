> Concise structure for chainable paths

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krzjoa/learning-R")
```
## Example
If you are using RStudio, you know that among many excellent features of this IDE the **path autocompleteion**. However, you can also meet situations, when that may be not enough.

Most of all, I mean some bigger projects, where you are storing some complex file structure in **config**. 

```{r example}
library(path.chain)
## basic example code
```
